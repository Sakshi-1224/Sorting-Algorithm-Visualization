# Sorting Algorithm Visualization
# Overview
The Sorting Algorithm Visualization project is an interactive tool that visually demonstrates how popular sorting algorithms work. Using this project, users can observe the step-by-step process of sorting arrays through animations, making it easier to understand the logic behind these algorithms.
# Features
- Interactive visualizations for various sorting algorithms, including:
 - Bubble Sort
 - Selection Sort
 - Insertion Sort
 - Merge Sort
 - Quick Sort
- Customizable array size by giving inputs to the array.
- User-friendly interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Intuitive controls to start and reset the visualization.
- Generate sorted array.
# Technologies Used
- HTML: Structuring the layout of the visualization.
- CSS: Styling the components and animations for an engaging user experience.
- JavaScript: Implementing the logic for sorting algorithms and their visualization.
